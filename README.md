# Are we alone in the universe? 

In this proyect we will take a closer look to the famous town of McMinnville, Oregon famous for its UFO history and enthusiasts gatherings. To build this page we used, bootstrap, css, javascript and html to create a table that hold data of UFOs information that can be filtered by data, city, state, country and shape. 

# Results 
The filters enables the users to input information to redefine their search, for example, to search for the event that happened in 1/1/2010 at boca raton, florida we can imput this information in the filters bar: 

**1. Date input**

**2. City **

# Summary
The drawback with this webpage is the date filter beacuse is a extact macht and those not have the flexibility to differeciate 1/1/2010 from 01/01/2010 and this may generate confusion to the user, this can be easyly fix a changing the rigidity of the date filter, another recommendation could be the creation of a to contansly update data on the website.
